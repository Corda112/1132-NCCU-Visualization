  "text": "The best wallets for your Crypto 2023, is your wallet on the list?:\n\nTrust Wallet ( @TrustWallet ): Trust wallet is top of my list because it is owned by Binance who I personally feel are one of if not the most reputable company in crypto. \n\nIt is super easy to use, supports a huge range of Cryptos with high security.\n\nTrust wallet is my go-to mobile wallet, with a built in web3 browser and it is non-custodial which is superb as that means nobody has knowledge of or access to your private keys. \n\nMetamask ( @MetaMask ): Metamask is also a wallet I use, in my opinion it isn’t a million miles away from Trust wallet, but lacks the ability to store Bitcoin which is my largest asset holding. \n\nMetamask has over 30 million active users and is known for its reliability, security and is also non-custodial. \n\nFinally, I would go with the Cryptocom wallet ( @cryptocom ), with a strong security presence using biometrics and Secure Enclave tech on IOS devices. They also have an interest system for around 20 crypto’s. \n\nAgain backed by a reputable exchange which makes it all the more appealing in my eyes. Note that you don’t have to have an account on the exchange. \n\nOverall, this is not financial advice and you should do your own research before using any of the mentioned wallets.",

  "text": "✅𝐒𝐄𝐂 𝐯𝐬 𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐭 (𝐖𝐚𝐫 𝐀𝐠𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐨, 𝐅𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐨𝐦 𝐨𝐟 𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐞𝐜𝐡, & 𝐑𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐚𝐜𝐭)\n\nFirst they ignore you\nThen they laugh at you\nThen they fight you\nThen you win - TBD\n\n🔹𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭'𝐬 𝐚𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞?\n\nThis case will go down in history. Richard Heart has the attention of crypto and the world. \n\nThere is more to this case than meets the eye. One may be mistaken in thinking this case is soley about Richard Heart, HEX, PulseChain and PulseX. Whoever wins this case will set legal precedent in crypto law for years to come. This means projects like Ethereum and such are at risk as well in the scenario that a bad precedent is set. It is evident that the government wants to gain control over things like crypto. Whether you were an investor in Ripple (XRP) or not, if you enjoy crypto freedom, then everyone ought to stand behind them, support them, and root for them. Recently they were victorious against the SEC in their multi year long lawsuit. The same applies to this case. If freedom of speech, & the right to transact is important to you - everyone in crypto should be rooting for Richard Heart. \n\n🔹𝐔𝐧𝐟𝐚𝐢𝐫 𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐇𝐄𝐗 (𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐬𝐰𝐚𝐩)\n\nImagine you are Hayden Adams (the creator of Uniswap). You have just built a revolutionary 'decentralized' product where people can buy and sell crypto in a permissionless way. Richard Heart popularizes your product by telling all the Hexicans about your invention. In the process countless people in the HEX community end up getting the UNI airdrop. HEX becomes responsible for some of the highest amount of volume and activity on-chain helping your project and spreading the word. Yesterday, Uniswap marked HEX as an \"unsupported asset\". For lack of better terms, Uniswap single handedly spit on Richard Heart and HEX for helping them out in the early days. To make matters worse they consider themselves to be decentralized, and yet specifically target HEX. What's your problem Hayden Adams, do you dislike Richard Heart? Do you dislike HEX investors? Do you not believe in decentralization? This is simply an attack, shame on Uniswap. Uniswap has not acted when there were obvious scams and rugpulls, but specifically targets HEX today. \n\n🔹𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐭\n\nAs an outsider it is very easy to dislike or not understand someone like Richard Heart. Why do I say this? Because I thought he was a scammer and I didn't trust him at first. Imagine someone tuning in for the first time and seeing a man with designer cloths twerking talking about crypto. This typically isn't the type of person you'd want to take seriously. However, if you take the time to dig deeper you will be shocked. In my opinion Richard Heart is one of the brighest minds in crypto who really cares about the small guys as well as our primary basic rights of freedom. In specific the freedom of speech and the right to transact are very relevant to this case. Richard Heart is the type of person where if you just listen for ten minutes, you will gain a wealth of knowledge and perspectives that you may have never thought of. How do I know this? I've spent countless hours watching his highly engaging videos. I am not sure whether the SEC underestimates the wit of Richard Heart, but I believe he is easily top three best to represent crypto. \n\n🔹𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐭𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐤 𝐢𝐧 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐜𝐥𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐬?!\n\nSimply put - outrage marketing. Every action is strategic and surgical. In his older videos he has mentioned that he would wear a black t-shirt and speak his mind. Unfortunately this wasn't enough to get the proper amount of attention and eyes to do what he always wanted to accomplish. One of his goals was to make the best crypto built for the greatest price appreciation the world had ever seen. He was very successful in business before crypto, and even mined BTC blocks for cents back in the early days of Bitcoin. It's not about the money for him - his ultimate goal is legacy, glory, but most importantly love from his peers. \n\nI have tracked down 6+ older clips of Richard admitting that the stuff he does and wears is completely ridiculous. It's just about getting as many eyes as possible, then for those who stick around educating and teaching them about stuff that actually matters. To put into perspective how effective this tactic is, Richard single handedly tripled his Twitter follower count in the midst of the bear market. Plenty of clips and memes were created in the process - genius marketing. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is the guy in designer isn't Richard Heart at all. Unfortunately that's what gets peoples attention, and he is the type of person to do whatever it takes to accomplish his goals. Months ago he has pivoted to being \"humble\". This was the real Richard Heart all along. I totally understand why some people dislike him, but I don't think they have met the real Richard. \n\n🔹𝐈𝐭 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬𝐧'𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐢𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐭\n\nThis case is about crypto precedent, the freedom of speech, and the fundamental right to transact. Richard Heart doesn't work for you, doesn't work for us, doesn't work for anyone. It's just you and the smart contract code when it comes to his project(s). \n\n🔹𝐂𝐚𝐧 𝐂𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐝?\n\nFortunately you can't control immutable code, decentralization, smart contracts without admin keys, with validators spread all over the world supporting the network. Every action done on the blockchain is recorded forever on a spreadsheet we call the blockchain. This is essentially what Richard Heart has built with projects like HEX, PulseChain and PulseX. \n\n🔹𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐞! 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬\n\nIn the captivating documentary 'Highest of Stakes,' viewers are taken on an exhilarating journey alongside renowned entrepreneur Richard Heart as he embarks on a groundbreaking mission to revolutionize the world of finance. Fueled by his unwavering belief in the potential of blockchain technology, Heart sets out to create a game-changing network called HEX and PulseChain.\n\n🔹𝐋𝐞𝐭 𝐦𝐞 𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐠𝐮𝐲𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤!\n\nI want to know your thoughts. Feel free to educate me, add stuff, love me, or hate me.\n\nThese are just my opinions, nothing is stated as fact. \n\nMake sure to like, comment, retweet!\nIf you made it this far don't forget to follow and bell button!😎👽❤🚀⚡",

Hence, a #BTC surge seems inevitable.\n\n#Bitcoin is attracting a lot of attention now. Some are trying to time the market, others prioritize time in the market. The latter will likely reap the most rewards.\n\nIt's mostly short-term holders who are selling. Long-term holders see #BTC as their exit strategy.\n\nI predict several liquidity crunches in #Bitcoin's trading volume, followed by rallies. If the current demand materializes, I suspect we're all underestimating the bullish potential. If not, I'll appreciate the chance to accumulate more #BTC at lower prices.

  "text": "When I discovered that #Bitcoin was the most biblically compatible monetary network ever invented, I became obsessed with orange pilling my fellow believers. \n\nEarly on, I wished there was a resource I could use to help take a Christian from, \"Why #Bitcoin?\" to \"#Bitcoin is monetary justice.\"\n\nThis is why I wrote, \"The Bible and Bitcoin.\" It's an easy to read, biblically sound resource to help Christians see why #Bitcoin is a Godly solution to central banking. \n\nThis book is the PERFECT ice breaker to talk to your church, pastor and believing friends about #Bitcoin. \n\nIt comes with a study guide that anybody can use to lead a small group in their churches, QR codes to helpful documentaries and so much more!!! \n\nHere's a sneak peak!!!! If you stop it frame by frame you might be and to read it all for free!!! \n\nWant to read chapter 1 for free? Go to https://t.co/XK1NT0YCAA and sign up to read chapter 1.\n\nBook will be available August 31st for purchase.",

  "text": "\"If silver is gonna 1000x, I will walk into my kitchen right now, I will melt all my silverware, and I will sell it at market.   \n\nIf gold is gonna rally, Elon Musk will find more on Mars. This is a super important point...  \n\n#Bitcoin is the only monetary instrument in the history of our species that is fixed. It does not matter how much more demand comes into the asset class, no one will ever be able to make more of it.  \n\nThere are 2 things I can guarantee you in my life:   \n\n- That I’ll die  \n- There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin   \n\nAnd those are the 2 things that I can only value; is my life and my Bitcoin.   \n\nSo it is the only fixed supply asset, it’s not that complicated. It’s gonna go up because everything else can be issued more.  \n\nThe only thing that is clear to us and clear to our customers is that you cannot hold and save in dollars anymore.   \n\nI think there is going to be a new era of the US dollar where inflation will enter and normalize 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10%. The days of 2% inflation are over. The FED really blew this thing up.  \n\nYou can call it inflation because the CPI is a load of nonsense, right? Like the government is going to tell me how the dollar is inflating based on a basket of instruments.   \n\nLike my Netflix subscription or my Caesar salad doesn’t actually tell me how well the dollar is doing or how much it’s being devalued.   \n\nMiami real estate does, Bitcoin does. Bitcoin is up over 50% this year. You’re telling me the dollar isn’t inflating? You’re out of your mind. I’m not listening to that.  \n\nThe FED and the whole monetary system is based on trust and they constantly, they constantly break that trust.   \n\nIt would be the equivalent to there’s a fire outside my house, I smell the smoke and someone tells me, “No no no it’s a bunch of teenagers putting on a bonfire.”   \n\nOkay, but I hear one police siren, are you sure it’s a bonfire? “Yea, yea yea it’s a bonfire.” Now I hear 10 sirens, 100 sirens, now my whole community is running out.   \n\nI’m not gonna get up and look outside the window and see what’s going on? I don’t believe them for a second, you have to be absolutely crazy to believe the federal reserve right now. They’re full of it and I don’t have to because I own Bitcoin.  \n\nThere’s no one that can deflate my instrument. I get to hold it, save in it, I know the monetary policy, I sleep like a baby, like the baby face that I am.   \n\nI think you’re crazy to believe the FED and these swap lines and treating these assets at par. It’s a gimmick, it’s a scam.\" -@JackMallers⚡",

Notice the similarities...\n\n1. Both had an epic first run\n2. A major pullback in the middle of the bull cycle.\n3. The second bull run puts in a new high.\n4. Both ran on crazy optimism and hyped #Crypto craze for BTC and AI craze for Semi's, anchored by $NVDA.\n\nImportant to remember that psychology of investors is the same whether in crypto, #stocks or commodities. Therefore patterns tend to (generally) repeat over time. Greed and fear rule, investor behavior has stayed the same for thousands of years.\n\nThe hype for AI is arguably identical in emotion to the hype of crypto in 2021.\n\nBitcoin collapsed from the highs of 69k to 15k, are the semi's replicating this pattern and about to implode?\n\n@intocryptoverse @leadlagreport @DanielaCambone @michaeljburry @CarterBWorth",

It's a long game. (1883x)\n\n353 Billion PLSX(1.7%) can be bought today for around $5.68 Million. (Limit Order)\n\nOver 396 days(13 months~) Bitcoin inflates to create 1.7% of 21M Supply(357,000 BTC) \nRemember that Supply is the Enemy of Price.\n\nMeanwhile in just 90 days PLSX has REMOVED 1.7% of its Supply. Put another way, In less than 1/4th of the time it took for Bitcoin to create 1.7% MORE SUPPLY, we have actually reduced our Supply by 1.7%.",

  "text": "This may be one of the last times to load up before the next bull cycle\n\nFrom $15k to $31k, $BTC has been on a hell of a run since Nov 22.. but we are now seeing signs of weakness in motion\n\nThis is par for the course for #bitcoin going into its four year halvening schedule\n\n$BTC bottoms.. an impressive bounce.. retracement into/before halvening.. bull run post halvening\n\nWith data suggesting a larger pullback on the horizon for the global economy resulting in a recession.. it may swing the scales slightly in the favour of a #crypto retracement over the next 6-9 months\n\nBut.. this is where a wealth of opportunity lies\n\nIf you have not experienced a true bull cycle before.. then boy, are you in for a shock..\n\nWith #bitcoin usually leading the charge from the front-line, an abundance of liquidity pours its way into the space.. once that liquidity is here, it spills into nearly every area of #crypto \n\nMany will make impressive returns during this period.. whether that be through cunning or luck..\n\nBut those who will maximize their gains are those who are positioned BEFORE the bull cycle even begins\n\nThis is where the beauty lies within a bear market.. \n\nOf course they can be brutal and costly for most, but if you are able to find the right project at the right price.. it can be life changing\n\nIn a bear market, no one is watching.. the large majority of people have thrown in the towel and its left to the nerds to stick to their hobby of playing with magic internet money in their moms basements.. but those people who scampered for the door will return\n\nThey will make up the crowd who begin to take notice once again when they start hearing on the news about #bitcoin approaching new ATHs.. or their friend boasting about how their son managed to buy a new sports car with money he made from this hot new #crypto called $ETH.. or was it $XRP? I can't remember what she told me.. \n\nWhen nobody gives a shit.. that's when you should be paying the most attention\n\nIf you are reading this, then that means you are, so congrats.. because you are here right when it matters the most\n\nMost projects don't become bad projects because the price is lower than it was 12 months ago.. in fact, they are most likely better thanks to a year of full on development\n\nWith all the attention gone.. price in the dumps.. and real tangible growth.. it offers a unique once in a lifetime opportunity\n\nOf course, most projects will still be dogshit.. but sprinkled in that pile of muck will be true fundamental gems..\n\nThese are what you are seeking.. and you should be seeking them when no-one else is watching\n\nYes.. people will make great gains when bullish conditions return.. but positioning near the bottom will allow you to increase the percentage of gains by a staggering amount\n\nPositioning now will most likely still look like a genius move at the top of the next cycle..\n\nBut.. this may be the last dip we get before the next cycle begins, and that is where the pot of gold is sitting at the end of the rainbow\n\nBargain bucket prices on the menu before a sea of liquidity enters the market.. it makes the mouth water, huh?\n\nNow, of course.. the dip may not come and $BTC may continue on its upward trajectory, nor do I think we take out the lows of $15.5k.. but if you have capital available to tackle any upcoming market retracement, then now may be the time to strategize on identifying projects you want to own for the entirety of the next bull cycle\n\nI have price levels set on entries I would like on strong fundamental projects like $TAO, $KAS, $QNT.. ones I think will outperform the rest of the market in a large way going forward\n\nAlso.. projects I perceive to be largely undervalued like $CHEQ, $MC, $FACT, $BBANK etc\n\nBut.. you need to identify your own projects, following your own strategies.. What you look for in a project may not be what I look for.. and vice-versa\n\nThe point is.. we may be entering a time of maximum opportunity\n\nSo.. if you don't have a plan drawn up of how to tackle this next 6-9 month period and beyond..\n\nI suggest creating a fucking plan.. you won't regret it",

  "text": "I think some of you can identify with the following: \n\nI came to #Bitcoin because I wanted to make money. Completely unaware of the consequences this decision would have on my future and certainly the rest of my life, the initial incentive to get closer to financial freedom very quickly turned into my world view being taken in hand, dropped and broken into a thousand parts that were rearranged by Bitcoin.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin attracted me, the value behind Bitcoin holds me. Even though there is probably a capitalist in all of us: should Bitcoin ever fail - for whatever reason - and every part of those 21,000,000 units of absolute scarcity fall to 0, I never regret my decision to have learned about Bitcoin, to have taken time, to have understood it, to have called it my property, and to have shown it to my fellow human beings.\n\nThe personality development, the insights, the brilliant relationships with people from all over the world who think and feel the same way are more valuable than any amount of money. To stand up for something with heart and humanity alone, which is probably the only thing that can still help the world, should make us all proud.\n\nYou don't need to be ashamed of something or be afraid of it if it is as human as Bitcoin. Even if it were to fail.\n\nKeep going everyone, keep spreading Bitcoin. Your work is immeasurably important to the world and the universe will repay you 1000 fold.",

  "text": "It's time to break down exactly how this new #Bitcoin price model works...\n\nAs I said this is derived from my November 28th Cycles Theory.\n\nThis Theory calls tops and bottoms with a +/- 21 day accuracy and tells us what happens in each given year\n\nTops and bottoms come at these dates:\n\nTops = +/- 21 days from Nov 28th end of red year (red dots)\n\nBottoms = +/- 21 days from Nov 28th beginning of green year (green dots)\n\nThe model starts on the day of the first halving, Nov 28th 2012.\n\nCycles have formed in between each date of Nov 28th.\n\nLet's get into what happens during each year based on my N28CT and this price model:\n\nGreen year (Accumulation) = Bitcoin forms a bottom at the beginning of the year +/- 28 days from Nov 28th. This is the year of the best cycle buying prices, and the best time to accumulate. \n\nPrice also moves towards the median price. (half of previous ATH). This is the first price that can be predicted labeled with blue lines, and their blue dot when price touches it.\n\nBlue Year (Preparation for New ATHs) = Bitcoin spends time around the blue line (median), and then makes an advance towards new ATHs (small red line).\n\nRed Year (New ATHs) = Price makes new ATHs during this year. Bitcoin follows the red trends outlined according to their diminishing pattern. This has been 70, 60, and 50 degrees in order for cycles so far. Implying the next would be 40 and 30.\n\nPrice makes its cycle top +/- 21 days from Nov 28th at the end of the year.\n\nOrange Year (Bear Market) = After becoming over-valuated at the cycle high, Bitcoin moves to undervaluation. On this scale, this has always been at a 44-degree descent. We can then find the next cycle bottom price using this measurement, which will come at the end of the year.\n\nUsing this model give us these predictions:\n\nCycle Top Price 2025: 140k\n\nCycle Bottom Price 2026: $27,000\n\nMedian Price Next Cycle: 70k\n\nCycle Top Price 2029: 190k\n\nCycle Bottom Price 2030: 36k\n\nMany people don't like to hear these prices, sorry. It's the results of the model. If the prices were higher they would show on the chart.\n\nEach target is judged strictly according to the angle sequences.\n\nI know you all have probably heard some pretty outlandish targets over the years, the Bitcoin community does a great job of that.\n\nReflect back and think how many there were last cycle! How did that pan out?\n\nSame arguments, institutional adoption and scarcity. I heard that a lot when I was selling all my Bitcoin at 54k in April 2021.\n\nHere's something else I'll tell you most people won't... don't go and blindly follow this model. \n\nAlways use data from many sources to come to conclusions! Setting price targets dooms you to fail. They are for speculation and possibilities, not financial decisions.\n\nRemember how many people were lost looking for 100k last cycle top. What happened to them?\n\nHere's a last question for you to think on, are you prepared if that happens again? I am!",

At currently $29,000 per Bitcoin, that makes ~$545.2 billion equivalent in US dollars.\n\nWhile it came to this number, 805,352 Bitcoin blocks were added to the Genesis Block since early 2009. Over a period of nearly 15 years, increasingly more energy, time and resources have been devoted to the Bitcoin network every single minute by more and more people around the world, to in the end adding up to just 0.178% of the value of the current global debt of ~$305 trillion, caused by a broken monetary system.\n\nThe Bitcoin network right now is worth 0.178% of the worlds total debt. These are just the ratios to global debt.\n\nAgain, is Bitcoin overvalued?\n\nWhen you understand how uniquely Bitcoin works, which is in a decentralized way perfectly sophisticated symbiosis of many individual components working together like Swiss clockwork finely tuned hand in hand, all backed by physics and mathematics, which is the language of the universe and energy is its currency, then you realize almost in awe how light years away Bitcoin must be from the word 'overvalued'.\n\nBitcoin is so ridiculously undervalued that it is always worth buying Bitcoin - no matter when.\n\nAnd besides: financial freedom is the smallest reason to own Bitcoin.

  "text": "Bitcoin Spot ETFs are potentially VERY BAD for security, long term.\n\nLet me explain something:\n\nBitcoin (the network) currently pays 6.25 $BTC (the token or coin) every ~10 minutes, which then gets distributed by mining pools 99% of the time.\n\n(it has been REALLY HARD to win a full Bitcoin block by \"solo mining\" for a long time)\n\nIn the year 2140, Bitcoin will experience a final halving event. \n\nBut if you look at the inflation chart below then you should see the practical reality: \n\nBitcoin could stop being profitable to mine based on the block reward alone MUCH sooner than that.\n\nWhat helps maintain profitability?\n\nFees.\n\nBottom-Line-Up-Front (BLUF) is that as the block reward decreases, ONE of the biggest recent factors in Bitcoin's economic incentive for SECURITY (\"mining\") is fees.\n\nTransactions generate fees.\n\nMinting ordinal inscriptions generate fees.\n\nOn-chain DeFi (sites like @NOWPFinance) generates fees.\n\nAll of these fees are added to the current 6.25 BTC payout to give incentive to the world to absolutely CRUSH the hashrate of Bitcoin, and spend an increasing amount of effort into solving more hashes.\n\nKnow what DOESN'T give Bitcoin's layer 1 network fees?\n\nOff-chain orderbooks.\n\nCEX's, escrows, and (taps glass) ETFs.\n\nAll of these remove transaction volume from Bitcoin's layer 1, which 100% DELETES the built-in fee incentive.\n\n\"But Seth, an ETF will usher in mass adoption!\"\n\nOK, so you want decreased security funding, and you want it AT SCALE?\n\n(BTW this is the same fundamental problem of Lightning Network or @ElonMusk's previous offer to shift DOGE to proof of stake)\n\nSo, the more adoption a Bitcoin Spot ETF receives, the LESS SECURE the native asset- Bitcoin- becomes.\n\n\"But Seth, isn't that priced in? Won't Bitcoin's price appreciation make the decreased fees palatable to miners?\"\n\nNo.\n\nBecause it will substantially decrease the number of fees actually paid (fully DELETING the majority of them) and in ways we can't forecast very well.\n\nBitcoin security has absolutely gone through some rough patches- MANY entities have folded/gone bankrupt over building too much mining infrastructure too soon.\n\nI LIKE the idea of price discovery & appreciation.\nI WANT to be financially free because of my good habits in crypto.\n\nBut, like most people, I NEED for Bitcoin to be sustainably secure more than I need it to make me accidentally rich.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf this was helpful, consider signing up for my FREE \"21 Lessons\" series at https://t.co/WyDeVcEnup",

  "text": "The mathematical significance of 1 #Bitcoin  in relation to time is huge. Let me show you why:\n\nFirst, it is interesting to know how much 1 Bitcoin represents in percentage terms measured against the total amount of Bitcoin ever available.\n\n1/21,000,000 equals 0.0000000476%, very little. However, Bitcoin has something ingenious embedded in it. With the halving epochs, time takes on a special role for Bitcoin:\n\nIn the first period, 50 Bitcoin are created every 10 minutes on average, 600 seconds, or 1 Bitcoin every 12 seconds. Every 12 seconds 0.0000000476% of the total supply.\n\nToday in 2023, there are 6.25 new Bitcoin every 600 seconds, or 1 Bitcoin per 96 seconds. Every 96 seconds 0.0000000476% of the total. When the fourth halving arrives in a few months, it will take 192 seconds - 3 minutes and 12 seconds - for each new Bitcoin.\n\nWhen will the time come that 1 year must pass before 1 Bitcoin is created?\n\nLet's jump to 2092: the block subsidy is 0.0001192 Bitcoin. It will take more than a year to find a full Bitcoin: 1/0.0001192 = 83,893 blocks ≈ 838,930 minutes ≈ 1.6 years. Just over 2 Bitcoin are issued in this halving period.\n\nThe same amount of new value that is created today in just 96 seconds, will ~68 years later take over a year and a half to be created.\n\nBut Bitcoin shows us its full potential of the inflation plan the closer we get to the total amount: if only 0.0000000476% - i.e. the last Bitcoin - is missing, it will take about 35 years until this last Bitcoin becomes usable for mankind.\n\nWhat started with 12 seconds in 2009 will reach its zenith in 2140, when from the years 2104/2106 on, ~35 years of time are needed to create the last full Bitcoin.\n\nWith each halving, the period until a new Bitcoin is created doubles. It will become increasingly difficult, incredibly difficult for anyone to obtain fresh Bitcoin as time progresses.\n\nHorrible things like man made devastating wars will hardly be feasible and affordable anymore, because Bitcoin is simply too rare to be able and willing to wage war with it.\n\nIn the long run it needs mathematics to create peace, because man alone will probably never be able to do it.\n\nModern man: finally embrace the beauty of mathematics. The beauty of Bitcoin.",

Imagine owning a rare sword that holds real value outside the game!\n\nIn addition, NFTs enable cross-game #interoperability, where items acquired in one game can be used in another. This opens up exciting possibilities for gamers, fostering creativity and collaboration across different virtual worlds.\n\nAs the world of #blockchain gaming evolves, NFTs will continue to #empower players, bridging the gap between virtual and real-world economies. \n\nGet ready to level up your gaming experience with NFTs! 🎮💪🌐\n\nNFTs project you should be checking out are: \n@Pocket_Cows @Delta_Flare @VoltInuOfficial \n@BullsApesProj \n@Passengers_NFT\n@unstoppableweb \n\nAny other projects I should be looking into?👀✨\n\n#BlockchainGaming #NFTs #DYOR #Domains #Crypto #gaming #GameFi",

You can't even imagine it. In a world where numbers, paper money and credit are getting bigger, more frequent and more arbitrary, the world ever more hectic, chaotic and opaque, there has been a pulse of calm for nearly 15 years. Working like a compass in this ocean of noise and haphazardness.\n\nBitcoin's inflation is getting lower and lower, soon below 1%, even lower than gold. The amount per person is getting scarcer and scarcer. It's been hair-trigger verifiable and measurable for eternity since the first second what numbers we'll be dealing with. The die is cast.\n\nBitcoin is an architectural masterpiece of physics and mathematics chiseled into the hardest construct in the universe.\n\nIf you're not even going to be late in 10 years, how can you be today?",
